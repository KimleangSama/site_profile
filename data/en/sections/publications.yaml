  paper:
    summary: The EV industry faces charging inefficiencies due to limited power supply and long wait times. We propose using the quantum approximation optimization algorithm (QAOA) to improve EV charging by solving the knapsack problem, which optimizes power use and reduces waiting. Our approach achieves up to 100% and 50% approximation ratios in noise-free and noisy settings, making it effective even with small circuit sizes.

  paper:
    summary: Electric power steering (EPS) has become a crucial driver-assistance system, utilizing data from various sensors to enhance the driving experience. Anomaly detection techniques improve vehicle safety by identifying irregularities. Our approach combines federated learning (FL) and deep learning (DL) to achieve effective anomaly detection, allowing all EPS-equipped vehicles to collaboratively train the model. Results show that our FL-DL model outperforms traditional centralized methods, achieving a 99.01% F1-Score and reducing error rates by 20% to 33.25%. It also offers benefits like faster training and lower communication costs.

    summary: Foveated rendering mimics human vision by focusing on sharpness in the center and blurring the periphery. We integrate this approach into object detection methods, finding that it significantly reduces detection time and false alarms, improving object detection performance. Our experiments show up to a 20% reduction in detection time compared to conventional rendering methods.

  paper:
    summary: The rise of IoT devices in electric power systems demands efficient power usage monitoring to maintain system health and detect abnormalities. Traditional methods struggle with the data volume. To address this, we propose an Autoencoder-based Federated Learning (FLAE) method. It combines AutoEncoder and Federated Learning networks for high-accuracy anomaly detection in distributed power systems. FLAE enables decentralized model training, reducing response time and data leakage issues. Our experiments confirm FLAE's effectiveness in anomaly detection without data transfer.

  paper:
    summary: In recent years, Electric Power Steering (EPS) has gained popularity due to its environmental benefits, including improved steering power and reduced fuel consumption. To maintain steering stability, sensors are crucial, and ensuring their consistency is vital. This paper presents a data-driven system for detecting defects and assessing linearity in EPS components, using vehicle speed intervals. Experimental validation on an EPS test jig, enhanced with a Graphical User Interface (GUI), shows the system's effectiveness with a 0.99% accuracy in defect detection and linearity assessment at different vehicle speeds.

  paper:
    summary: Traditional centralized anomaly detection methods for electrical power steering (EPS) systems lack adaptability to new anomalies. This paper introduces a two-stage deep learning approach for EPS sensor data anomaly detection. It utilizes an autoencoder to extract and compress features, followed by an LSTM network to capture feature dependencies and reconstruct outputs. An anomaly score based on reconstruction loss detects anomalies. Experiments using EPS data demonstrate our model's superior performance with 99% accuracy and a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve compared to other methods, making it a valuable tool for EPS anomaly detection.
