    summary: The growing use of Internet-of-Things devices in electric power systems has resulted in increased complexity and flexibility, making monitoring power usage critical for effective system maintenance and detecting abnormal behavior. However, traditional anomalous power consumption detection methods struggle to handle the vast amounts of data generated by these devices. While deep learning and machine learning are effective in anomaly detection, they require significant amounts of training data collected on centralized servers. This centralized approach results in high response time delays and data leakage problems. To address these challenges, we propose an Autoencoder-based Federated Learning method that combines the AutoEncoder and Federated Learning networks to develop a high-accuracy algorithm for identifying anomalies of power consumption data in distributed power systems. The proposed method allows for decentralized training of anomaly detection models among IoT devices, reducing response time and eventually solving data leakage issues. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the FLAE method in detecting anomalies without needing data transferring.

  paper:
    summary: In recent years, due to heightened environmental awareness, Electric Power Steering (EPS) has been increasingly adopted as the steering control unit in manufactured vehicles. This has had numerous benefits, such as improved steering power, elimination of hydraulic hose leaks and reduced fuel consumption. However, for EPS systems to respond to actions, sensors must be employed; this means that the consistency of the sensor's linear variation is integral to the stability of the steering response. To ensure quality control, a reliable method for detecting defects and assessing linearity is required to assess the sensitivity of the EPS sensor to changes in the internal design characters. This paper proposes a data-driven defect and linearity assessment monitoring system, which can be used to analyze EPS component defects and linearity based on vehicle speed interval division. The approach is validated experimentally using data collected from an EPS test jig and is further enhanced by the inclusion of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Based on the design, the developed system effectively performs defect detection with an accuracy of 0.99 percent and obtains a linearity assessment score at varying vehicle speeds.

  paper:
    summary: As anomaly detection for electrical power steering (EPS) systems has been centralized using model- and knowledge-based approaches, EPS system have become complex and more sophisticated, thereby requiring enhanced reliability and safety. Since most current detection methods rely on prior knowledge, it is difficult to identify new or previously unknown anomalies. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach that consists of a two-stage process using an autoencoder and long short-term memory (LSTM) to detect anomalies in EPS sensor data. First, we train our model on EPS data by employing an autoencoder to extract features and compress them into a latent representation. The compressed features are fed into the LSTM network to capture any correlated dependencies between features, which are then reconstructed as output. An anomaly score is used to detect anomalies based on the reconstruction loss of the output. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is demonstrated by collecting sample data from an experiment using an EPS test jig. The comparison results indicate that our proposed model performs better in detecting anomalies, with an accuracy of 0.99 and a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve than other methods providing a valuable tool for anomaly detection in EPS.
